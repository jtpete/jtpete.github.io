            <p>At the young age of sixteen I began to follow Jesus Christ's way for my life,
              instead of trying to do life my way.  Now for the past twenty-four years of my life
              I have pursued what it means continually change my ways to align with His ways.
              These changes led me to attend Seminary and earn my Masters in Divinity.  I lived in Florida, Iowa, and now back in Wisconsin.
              I have served at small churches, medium churches and large churches.  I have invested into the lives of others to help
              them as they try and navigate life's diffculties.</p>

            <p>On April 1, 2000 I married my wife Michelle.  Over the last 16 years of marriage we had three wonderful kids born in 2004, 2006, and
            2009.  The two older siblings are boys and the youngest is a girl.  Two years ago we added a dog, named Jaguar to the family, although my wife
            has regretted that decision ever since.  In the past 16 years of marriage we have moved eight times, in three different states and have owned seven different houses.
            Our family calls Milwaukee home and we plan to keep it that way.</p>

            <p>I have many hobbies, interests, and joys.  I have traveled the world to visit missionaries in Rwanda, Colombia and Peru.  I have vacationed in Mexico, Carribean, and the Bahamas.
            I like playing just about any sport, but particularly like, golf, volleyball, baseketball.  I spend most my time during the week running, although I don't really think of it as a sport,
            instead, I view is more as a great exercise.</p>
